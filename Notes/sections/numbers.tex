\subsection*(Numbers)

INT_MIN + INT_MAX = 1


One's complement: flip all of the bits + 1
Two's compeement: A - B = A + ~B

Big and small b.

Gb and GB

Kibibttes


MSB - LSB


UMAX
UMIN


check week4 bitbang cheatsheet

max is always odd number




\subsection*{Floating Point}
don't mix up $e$ and $E$


denorm = e always 0



NaN | -Normalized | -1 | -Denormalized | 0 | Denormalized 1 | Normalized | NaN



ABCD rule = offset + base + index * scale


leaq math! 

leaq rdi rsi 2      rax     = x + 2y
leaq 7 (rdi rsi 4)  rax     = x + 4y + 7
leaq rdi rsi 8      rax     = 9x




dereferencing a pointer = fetching what's at that address. (i think)
(\%register) is dereferencing in assembly 


max 6 parameters in function call rest on stack


the stack grows downwards, the number decreases

the heap grows up

the return value is in rax, eax, ax 

nop aligns the stack



ALU = Arithmetic Logical Unit




denormalized = very close to zero
normalized = far away from zero
special case = +INf -INF NaN



1 and 2's compliment and when to use each

ones:

1010 to 0101

two's:
