valid bit tells us we have something important there


tag is the id of the block







Look at disk access time math on the presentation, wee 11 lecture 2








nested arrarys

Typical question is about finding C for example
Array[i][j] = $A + (i*C+j)*K$



discaccess


architecture questions



cache question

stack question



start translating addresses from the right to left

0x135

0001-0011-0101


set index - tag - block offset

0001 0011 01 01
TTTT TTTT SS BB

tags are shared if they belong to the same memory approximate


tag is not the unique for all cache only the set



the bigger the address the bigger chance it's a miss


block alrady in cache:
write-through
write-back

block not already in cache:
write-allocate
no-write-allocate




direct map = only one block per set

n-way = many blocks in one set



tag is an id for block in a set, tag is unique per set


shifting and arithmetic shifting
