# Assignment 7


## Q1
This week we are starting a new chapter.
- True
- ~~False~~

This is true, the assembly chapter is the chapter for week 7


## Q2
The program counter keeps track of what instruction to run next. 
- True
- ~~False~~

Yes, it holds the memory address of the next instruction that would be executed.


## Q3
The Von Neuman model for computer architecture uses the unified memory model. 

- ~~True~~
- False


## Q4
The design of the x86 processor family use the Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) ideology. 
- ~~True~~
- False

No, is is completly different family.


## Q5
The frequency of a CPU is the only measure needed to know its true performance. 
- ~~True~~
- False

## Q6
Cache is just extra memory that the CPU can use to store temporary data during complex calculations.
- True
- ~~False~~

## Q7
A program compiled on one Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) can be copied and run, as is, on a different ISA.
- ~~True~~
- False

## Q8
The code we write in the programming language is exactly the same as the instructions run on the CPU.  
- ~~True~~
- False

## Q9
ARM is a CPU designer but not a CPU manufacture.
- True
- ~~False~~

## Q10
float is a 16 bit data type. 

- ~~True~~
- False

No, float is a 32-bit data type.

## Q11
The old IA32 architecture has 8 general purpose registers. 
- True
- ~~False~~

## Q12
%rax, %eax, %ax, %ah and %al are, in fact, all references the same register. 
- True
- ~~False~~

Yes, they point to different parts of the same register.

%rax is the full 64 bit register (bits 0-63)
%eax is the lower 32 bits of %rax (bits 0-31)
%ax is the lower 16 bits of %rax (bits 0-15)
%ah is the high 8 bits of %ax (bits 8-15 of %rax)
%al is the low 8 bits of %ax (bits 0-7 of %rax)

## Q13
Assembly has neither variable names nor datatypes as such.  
- ~~True~~
- False

Assembly has variables and has some form of data types.

## Q14
The move instruction always cleans up after it self by putting all 0's in the source. 
- ~~True~~
- False

No, it doesn't do that.

## Q15
In the ABCD rule, D can be any value.  
- ~~True~~
- False

No, the D is a multiplier for the index and is always: 1, 2, 4 or 8.


## Q16
In the ABCD rule: when it is used we will always see all 4 values given in the Assembly code.
- ~~True~~
- False

A: A constant displacement(a fixed number like 0x1000)
B: A base register (typically EBP or ESP in 32-bit)
C: An index register (any general-purpose register like EAX, ECX)
D: A scale factor( a multiplier for the index: 1,2,3 or 8)

[Base + Index + Scale + Displacement]

## Q17
Whenever we see ( some-register ) in assembly we know the register is a pointer and the action is to de-reference that pointer.  
- ~~True~~
- False

False, when a register is in brackets [] == Dereference. But without brackets it's being used as a regular value, not as a pointer.

## Q18
There is a register dedicated to keeping track of where the "top" stack is at all times 
- True
- ~~False~~

True, it's called %RSP.

## Q19
If we need more space on the stack and it grows, the address pointing to the "top" of the stack increases (i.e., it gets a higher value).   
- ~~True~~
- False

No, the address decreases downvards.

## Q20
Assuming both %rbx and %rcx contain memory addresses to valid memory; The following command is legal: 

movq (%rbx), (%rcx)

- ~~True~~
- False

No, it's not possible to move memory to memory directly. Both of these commands are dereferencing memory.
